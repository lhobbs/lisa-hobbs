            <p>Education is something I have always been passionate about.  During my time at CU, I found many different avenues to reach kids and get into classrooms. While I've been at DPS I've found more ways to interact with our students. I love being around the bubbling excitement, curiosity and energy of these kids.  Sometimes we need to step away from the hustle and bustle of adulting and jump into the imaginative mindset of a child.</p>
            <h5>Bilingual Preschool</h5>
            <p>My first semester I had the opportunity to volunteer in a preschool through the Spanish department.  Every Tuesday I would leave the busy and sometimes stressful vibe of campus and walk into a classroom of curious two and three year olds.  Of course sometimes those were stressful days too because whether we are 19 or 3 we all have days of thinking that our lives are hard. Almost all of those students were native Spanish speakers so as they practiced their shapes and colors, I practiced my vocabulary.  I loved the challenge of using another language but even more I loved watching their development and growth as the semester went on.  </p>
            <h5>Teaching Course</h5>
            <p>The following year I took a course through the School of Education where we learned to develop lesson plans.  This was the first time I realized how much work our teachers put into preparing their lessons.  We made sure that our lessons encompassed the right state and federal standards of what, in my case 5th grade students, needed to learn that year.  We made sure we had the right ratios of lecture and discussion and that our lessons would include a hands on activity.  Throughout this course there were times I would observe the teacher’s lesson and then there were times that I would teach the lesson.  Having that real practice of being in a classroom working with these kids gave me great insight into everything our teachers do.</p>
            <h5>Society of Women Engineers</h5>
            <p>My sophomore through senior years I was a very active member of CU’s section of the Society of Women Engineers.  My involvement with this group really began when I started volunteering for the Girl Scout Days they would put on.  On these days, troops would bring in their girls and we’d go through stations of STEM activities with them.  In the mornings we would have the Brownies, who are the youngest groups, and by the end of the afternoon we had the Cadets, the oldest girls.  Being a part of the whole event you could really see the differences in the stages the girls were in.  The first grade girls would come in excited about everything.  While you were trying to give instructions about the activity, they would want to tell you every random story that popped into their minds.  When the middle schoolers stepped in, they were not as eager to speak up.  Our challenge was less on the activity and more on collaboration and trying to engage with their interests.  I loved the long days of different activities and working with so many different groups and ages that the next year, I applied to be on the board.  </p>
            <p>For my junior and senior year at CU, I was our section’s Director of Outreach.  What this meant was that I now got to coordinate and prepare all of our K-12 STEM outreach events.  I reached out to all of Boulder County’s elementary, middle and high schools to see who was interested in partnering with us.  I also connected with after school programs and other events that were going on in the community.  I brought in some help and managed our Outreach Committee to work with me on connecting with schools, planning activities and then carrying them out.  Over the course of those two years, I coordinated over 70 events and we reached over 1,000 different students.  Sometimes we’d go into an elementary school classroom and have them build houses of marshmallows and toothpicks, sometimes we’d work with a middle school on their current projects, sometimes we’d go into a high school and give a presentation about college and choosing engineering majors.  We worked closely with Cool Girls, an afterschool club for elementary school girls to learn about STEAM fields.  On Tuesdays they had girls in grades 1-3 and Thursdays they had girls in 4th and 5th.  Every other week we’d go to their club and do different engineering activities.  We worked with Peak to Peak Charter School to help them form an after school all girls engineering club for their high school that would meet every other week.  We talked to them about colleges and also did activities to show them the different engineering fields.  </p>
            <h5>Neuroscience Outreach</h5>
            <p>The human brain has always been fascinating to me.  While I was at CU, I took courses in cognitive and neuroscience.  With the neuroscience department I got involved in their elementary outreach program.  We helped develop the lesson plans with hands on activities to teach kids about the neurons that make up our brains, the different lobes and functions of our brains and the ways we can help keep our brains healthy and help them grow stronger. While most of our classes were in English classrooms, I had the opportunity to teach some kindergarten classes entirely in Spanish.  We not only taught the kids about their brains, but we worked with the teachers on activities that they could incorporate into their daily lessons to remind the kids how to take care of their brains. We gave them glitter jars that they could shake to simulate their busy minds and emotions and then as the glitter began to settle, they slowed their breaths and focused on calming their thoughts.  My favorite moment of teaching these classes was sitting in a group circle one day in a 1st grade class, in the midst of talking about the brain's functions, when the little boy next to me, grabbed me and said “My brain told me to hug you”.</p>
            <h5>Flatirons Community Church</h5>
            <p>I started volunteering in the preschool room when Flatirons Community Church opened their second campus in 2014.  Every other Sunday morning I’d get up and go hang out with 3-5 year olds.  We’d play games, color, read books and then learn about how much God loves us.  Sometimes we’d have to reluctantly pull kids away from their parents, but once we had the music playing, the kids would dance around forgetting that they were sad.  Soon after I moved to Denver, Flatirons opened their campus downtown.  I switched from the preschool room to the nursery. For the past couple of years I’ve spent my favorite Sunday mornings holding babies and playing kitchen with toddlers.  I’ve seen the growth and development of these kids, watched some become older brothers and sisters and built friendships with the other volunteers and families.</p>
            <h5>5th Grade STEM Class</h5>
            <p>Working for a school district means there are many opportunities to jump into classrooms and work with students.  I helped in a 5th grade class where they were learning different ways to use computers and electronics.  The students rotated to different stations and would pick up new activities to do in pairs for that week.  In one station, they learned to code with Scratch, and in another they learned how to design models for the 3D printer.  I served as the teacher's helper and would assist students when they got stuck or talk through what they were working on.  </p>
            <h5>CareerCoach Mentorship Program</h5>
            <p>I remember what it was like being in high school and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and where I should go to school, and what I should study.  That’s why I signed up for our CareerCoach program where I got to mentor a high schooler throughout the year.  The first semester focused on career exploration.  With my sophomore we looked up different types of jobs, talked about her passions and interests and came up with a short list of possible future careers.  As a larger group, we went on a couple trips to different offices to get a better idea what the working environments were like and to talk to different employees.  The second semester we focused more on future education.  My girl wants to become an accountant so we looked into different accounting programs across the state plus a few other programs in case she changed her mind later.  With our group we went on a tour of Metro State in Denver and had the opportunity to see more of their aviation program.  Then we went on a tour of my alma mater.  We got to compare the differences of being at a commuter school to being in a more traditional college setting.  We were able to ask current students questions, see a dorm room and check out some of the buildings and classrooms.  This program was a great way for students to see schools and workplaces and begin to think through their futures.</p>
